So now I begin to learn c by myself using this book, cPrimerPlus(the fifth edition).

I am really desired to improve my programming ability.

What's more, I have already been left little time.

As the old saying goes,

the best time to plant a tree is ten years ago,
and the next is now.

Just persist!
