So now I begin to learn c by myself using this book, cPrimerPlus(the fifth edition).

I will try to conclude all the examples and exercises in the book.
------------------------------------------------------------------
What I want to say:

I am really desired to improve my programming ability.

What's more, I have already been left little time.

As the old saying goes,

the best time to plant a tree is ten years ago,
and the next is now.

Just persist!
------------------------------------------------------------------
Attentions:

From 2016.04.17 (yesterday), I will no longer use Linux,

for the reasons that my visual machine runs too slowly and VS has a strong ability to 

diaoshi codes.

Now I use sublime to edit the codes and VS to run the codes.

Wish you happy!
